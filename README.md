# OrnamentOrbPCB
A simple PCB designed to resemble a classic orb ornament with spots for nine 5mm LEDs.

<b>*This design has just been sent off to fab and has not been recieved back yet, so the design has not been 100% tested.* </b>

But with the holidays coming I thought it might be fun to share the project just in case anyone wanted to view, modify or take a chance in sending their own off to fab in time for the impending 2018 holidays.

I'm including the Eagle files, BOM, .png art files and bitmap art files.
